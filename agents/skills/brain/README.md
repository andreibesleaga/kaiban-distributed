# Neuro-Cognitive Design Patterns

**Software Architecture modeled after the Human Brain.**

This directory contains **Skills** and **Architectures** derived from Neuroscience, Cognitive Psychology, and Epistemology. These patterns treat the Software System not as a machine, but as a **Cognitive Entity**.

## 🧠 The Complete Cognitive Architecture

We model the agent as a **Cognitive Turing Machine** with distinct functional areas:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Sensation & Action (Body)"
        S["Sensors (Logs/Inputs)"] -->|Perception| P[Feature Binding]
        M["Motor (Tools)"] -->|Action| W[World]
        W -->|Feedback| S
    end

    subgraph "The Conscious Loop (System 2)"
        P -->|Coalitions| GW[Global Workspace]
        GW -->|Broadcast| WM[Working Memory]
        WM -->|OODA Loop| C[Consciousness Controller]
        C -->|Motor Command| M
    end

    subgraph "Long-Term Memory (System 1)"
        WM <-->|Retrieval| EM[Episodic Memory]
        WM <-->|Habits| BG[Basal Ganglia]
    end

    subgraph "Self-Improvement (Evolution)"
        C -->|Meta-Cognition| SI[Self-Improvement]
        SI -->|Rewrite| DNA[System Prompts]
    end
```

### 1. The Body (Sensation & Action)
- **Sensory-Motor Skill** ([`sensory-motor.skill.md`](sensory-motor.skill.md)): Treats tools as "muscles" with proprioception (error feedback) and inputs as "senses" (multimodal binding).
- **Active Inference** ([`active-inference.skill.md`](active-inference.skill.md)): The low-level control loop that minimizes surprise between expectation and tool output.

### 2. The Mind (Consciousness & Control)
- **Consciousness Loop** ([`consciousness-loop.skill.md`](consciousness-loop.skill.md)): Implementation of the **OODA Loop** (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) and Hofstadter's "Strange Loop" for self-reference.
- **Global Workspace** ([`global-workspace.skill.md`](global-workspace.skill.md)): The "Spotlight" where competing inputs form a unified context.

### 3. The Evolution (Learning)
- **Self-Improvement** ([`self-improvement.skill.md`](self-improvement.skill.md)): The ability to rewrite its own "DNA" (Prompts) based on failure analysis.
- **Learning & Adaptation** ([`learning-adaptation.skill.md`](learning-adaptation.skill.md)): "Neuroplasticity" mechanisms for strengthening successful paths.
