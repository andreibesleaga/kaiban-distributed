---

## 2. Problem Statement

[2-4 sentences describing the current situation and what's broken or missing.
Include: who is affected, how often, what the impact is.]

**Current behavior:** [What happens today]
**Desired behavior:** [What should happen after this feature]

---

## 3. User Stories

<!-- Format: As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit] -->

- As a **[role]**, I want to **[action]**, so that **[benefit]**.

## 4. EARS Requirements

<!-- Use EARS syntax. Each requirement must be verifiable (no "should", "might", "fast") -->

### 4.1 Ubiquitous Requirements (always applies)
```
THE SYSTEM SHALL [requirement].
```

### 4.2 Event-Driven Requirements (triggered by an event)
```
WHEN [trigger event]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [response].
```

### 4.3 State-Driven Requirements (while in a state)
```
WHILE [system state]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior].
```

### 4.4 Optional Feature Requirements (feature flags)
```
WHERE [feature is enabled/condition is true]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior].
```

### 4.5 Unwanted Behaviors (negative requirements)
```
THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT [forbidden behavior].
```

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Each criterion: testable, atomic, pass/fail — one per requirement -->

| ID | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC-01 | User is logged in | User clicks "Submit" with valid data | System creates record and returns 201 |
| AC-02 | User is not authenticated | User attempts to access /api/protected | System returns 401 |
| AC-03 | Form has invalid email | User submits | System returns 422 with field-level error |

---

## 6. Data Model (Sketch)

<!-- Rough entity diagram — full schema in SPEC_TEMPLATE.md -->
<!-- For visual ER diagram, use Mermaid erDiagram or Draw.io -->

```
Entity: [Name]
Fields:
  id:          uuid (primary key)
  [field]:     [type] ([constraints: required, unique, max length])
  created_at:  timestamp
  updated_at:  timestamp

Relationships:
  [Entity] has many [Entity]
  [Entity] belongs to [Entity]
```

### 6.1 Visual Data Model

<!-- Generate from sketch using image-recognition + Mermaid, or create directly -->
<!-- If you have a hand-drawn ER diagram, use visual-specs.skill to convert -->

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ENTITY_A ||--o{ ENTITY_B : "has many"}
    ENTITY_A {
        uuid id PK
        string name
        timestamp created_at
    }
```

**Full visual data model**: See [Visual Spec Package](VISUAL_SPEC_PACKAGE_TEMPLATE.md) Section 4.

---

## 7. API Surface (Sketch)

<!-- Rough API design — full contract in SPEC_TEMPLATE.md and docs/api/openapi.yaml -->

```
POST   /api/v1/[resource]           Create
GET    /api/v1/[resource]           List (with pagination)
GET    /api/v1/[resource]/{id}      Get one
PATCH  /api/v1/[resource]/{id}      Partial update
DELETE /api/v1/[resource]/{id}      Delete
```

---

## 8. UI/UX Notes

<!-- Link to Figma, tldraw wireframes, or Excalidraw mockups -->
<!-- To convert hand-drawn wireframes: use sketch-to-diagram.skill or visual-specs.skill -->

**Designs:** [Link to Figma / tldraw .tldr wireframe / Excalidraw .excalidraw mockup]

**Wireframe files** (if created via tldraw MCP):
- [path/to/screen-name.tldr]

**Key interactions:**
- [What happens when the user does X]
- [Error state display]
- [Loading state]
- [Empty state]

**Accessibility requirements:**
- WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance required
- [any specific a11y requirements for this feature]

**Visual Spec Package**: [Link to VISUAL_SPEC_PACKAGE_TEMPLATE.md — Section 3 for UI wireframes, Section 2 for user flow diagrams]

|---|---|
| **Performance** | API responses < [X]ms at p99 under [Y] concurrent users |
| **Availability** | [X]% uptime SLO |
| **Security** | [Authentication required / Rate limited at X req/min / Data encrypted] |
| **Scalability** | Must handle [X] records / [Y] concurrent users |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.2 Level AA |
| **Browser Support** | [Modern browsers / IE11 / Mobile Safari] |
