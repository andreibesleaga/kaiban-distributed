## Active Debt Items

### TD-[NNN]: [Short Title]

**Debt ID:** TD-[NNN]
**Type:** Code | Test | Architecture | Security | Dependency | Documentation
**Location:** `[file path]:[line number]`
**Detected:** [date] by [tech-debt.skill / code review / etc]
**Status:** OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | RESOLVED

**Description:**
[What is the debt? What is wrong with the current implementation?]

**Why it's debt:**
[What principle or best practice is being violated?
e.g., "Cyclomatic complexity is 18 — exceeds limit of 10.
Makes the function hard to test and modify."]

**Impact** (H/M/L): [H]
[How does this debt slow down development or create risk?
e.g., "Blocks all team members trying to add payment features.
Any change to this function causes unexpected failures."]

**Effort to fix** (H/M/L): [L]
[How much work is required to resolve this debt?
e.g., "Extract 3 validation functions — ~2 hours of focused work."]

**Priority:** P[1/2/3/4]
[P1 = High Impact + Low Effort | P2 = High Impact + High Effort
 P3 = Low Impact + Low Effort  | P4 = Low Impact + High Effort]

**Proposed fix:**
[Concrete approach to resolving this debt item]

```
Example:
1. Extract validateEmail() from UserController.update()
2. Extract validateAge() from UserController.update()
3. Extract validatePhone() from UserController.update()
4. Update tests to cover each extracted function independently
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] [Cyclomatic complexity of target function drops below 10]
- [ ] [All existing tests still pass]
- [ ] [New unit tests for each extracted function]
- [ ] [No new circular dependencies]

## Adding New Debt Items

Run `tech-debt.skill` to automatically scan and populate new entries.
Or add manually using the template above.

**Manual entry guidelines:**
1. Assign next sequential ID (TD-[next number])
2. Choose the most specific Type
3. Score Impact AND Effort honestly (not everything is high impact)
4. Propose a concrete fix (not "just refactor it")
5. Define testable acceptance criteria
