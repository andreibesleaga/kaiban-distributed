## Definition of Done — Per Phase

### S01 — Requirements
```
[ ] PRD.md created using PRD_TEMPLATE.md
[ ] All requirements written in EARS syntax (no "should" or "might")
[ ] Ambiguity layer completed — no unresolved questions
[ ] Out-of-scope section filled
[ ] Human explicitly approved PRD.md
[ ] SESSION_SNAPSHOT/S01_requirements.md created
[ ] AUDIT_LOG.md entry: HUMAN_APPROVED
```

### S02 — Design
```
[ ] Architecture approach documented in PLAN.md
[ ] C4 Level 1+2 diagrams in docs/architecture/ (or documented exception)
[ ] ADR created for every significant technology choice
[ ] Threat model completed for ALL security-sensitive features
[ ] Human approved architecture approach
[ ] SESSION_SNAPSHOT/S02_design.md created
```

### S03 — Specification
```
[ ] SPEC_TEMPLATE.md completed: domain model, API contracts, DB changes
[ ] OpenAPI spec at docs/api/openapi.yaml (or equivalent)
[ ] Migration plan documented (if DB changes)
[ ] Testing strategy defined per layer
[ ] Human approved technical specification
[ ] SESSION_SNAPSHOT/S03_specification.md created
```

### S04 — Tasks
```
[ ] All PLAN.md items decomposed into TASKS_TEMPLATE.md
[ ] Each task: achievable in ~15 minutes
[ ] Each task: has testable acceptance criteria
[ ] Tasks have correct dependency ordering
[ ] No ambiguous tasks ("do the stuff" — must be specific files/functions)
[ ] SESSION_SNAPSHOT/S04_TASKS.md created
```

### S05 — Implementation
```
[ ] All tasks in project/TASKS.md have status DONE (none TODO/IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED)
[ ] TDD followed for each task: failing test written first
[ ] Each task commit references the task ID
[ ] AUDIT_LOG.md has TASK_DONE entry for each task
[ ] SESSION_SNAPSHOT/S05_implementation.md created
```

### S06 — Testing
```
[ ] [test command] passes: 0 failing, 0 unexpected skips
[ ] Coverage >= 99% (run [coverage command])
[ ] Gate 1 Lint: 0 errors
[ ] Gate 2 Typecheck: 0 errors
[ ] Gate 3 Coverage: >= 99%
[ ] Gate 4 Integration: Docker Compose tests pass
[ ] Gate 5 Security: npm/composer audit clean (0 critical/high CVEs)
[ ] Gate 6 Complexity: max cyclomatic complexity < 10
[ ] Gate 7 EARS compliance: all requirements have tests
[ ] agentic-linter: 0 architecture violations
[ ] SESSION_SNAPSHOT/S06_testing.md created
```

### S07 — Security
```
[ ] security-audit.skill run on full codebase
[ ] SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md 100% complete
[ ] 0 critical CVEs in dependencies
[ ] 0 high CVEs unresolved (or risk accepted by human)
[ ] gitleaks detect: CLEAN (no secrets in git)

[ ] SESSION_SNAPSHOT/S08_review.md created
```

### S09 — Staging

[ ] Database migrations applied to staging
[ ] Smoke tests passing (health check + core user flows)
[ ] No error spike in monitoring after deploy
[ ] Performance within acceptable range
[ ] SESSION_SNAPSHOT/S09_staging.md created
```

### S10 — Production
```
