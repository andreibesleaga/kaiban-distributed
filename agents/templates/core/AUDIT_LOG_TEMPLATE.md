## Log Format

```
| Timestamp (ISO 8601) | Session ID | Agent/Human | Action Type | Description | Outcome | References |
```

**Session ID format:** `S[SDLC-phase]-[sequential-number]` (e.g., `S01-001`, `S05-023`)

**Action Types:**
| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `DECISION` | A choice was made between options |
| `PHASE_TRANSITION` | SDLC phase changed (sdlc-checkpoint.skill) |
| `TASK_DONE` | A task completed successfully |
| `TASK_BLOCKED` | A task is stuck, human decision needed |
| `QUALITY_GATE` | Quality gate pass/fail result |
| `SECURITY_FINDING` | Security issue found (include severity) |
| `ADR_CREATED` | Architecture decision documented |
| `HUMAN_ESCALATION` | Agent escalated to human (5 attempts exhausted) |
| `SELF_HEAL_ATTEMPT` | Agent tried to self-fix (include attempt N/5) |
| `RESEARCH_FINDING` | Authoritative source verified |
| `HUMAN_APPROVED` | Human provided approval/decision |
| `ERROR` | Unexpected error encountered |
| `ROLLBACK` | A change was reverted |

**Outcome values:** `SUCCESS` | `FAIL` | `PASS` | `OPEN` | `RESOLVED` | `APPROVED` | `REJECTED` | `ESCALATED`

## Instructions for Agents

1. **Append a new row** for every significant action (do NOT edit existing rows)
2. **Do NOT overwrite** this file — always append
3. **Reference artifacts** by path or URL in the References column
4. **Be specific** in Description — "fixed auth bug" is bad; "removed missing null check on user.email in UserService.update() line 42" is good
5. For HUMAN_ESCALATION: add a note row below the entry with the escalation report summary
