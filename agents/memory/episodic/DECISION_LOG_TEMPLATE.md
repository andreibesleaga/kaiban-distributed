| [e.g., Prisma cursor pagination requires `skip: 1`] | [Prisma official docs v5.x] | [Used in T-045 pagination feature] |

## Handoff Notes

<!-- What the NEXT session/agent needs to know to continue without context loss -->

```
State at handoff:
  - Current task: [T-NNN — description]
  - Why stopped: [session ended / context limit / blocked]
  - Critical context: [anything the next agent MUST know before starting]
  - Don't repeat: [approaches already tried and failed]
  - Human input pending: [questions/decisions waiting for human]
```
